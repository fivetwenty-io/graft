// Package reqdedup coalesces concurrent, identical backend requests into a
// single in-flight call: N references to the same secret within one merge
// produce one backend request. It is a thin, typed
// wrapper around golang.org/x/sync/singleflight so backend packages
// (internal/backends/vault, aws, nats) share one well-tested coalescing
// primitive instead of each hand-rolling its own.
//
// Group only coalesces callers that are genuinely concurrent for the same
// key; it is not a cache. Callers combine it with their own TTL cache (or
// nothing) to decide when a key is worth fetching at all - Group answers
// "how many in-flight fetches for this key right now", the cache answers
// "do we already know the answer".
