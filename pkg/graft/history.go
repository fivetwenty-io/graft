//     record at the recording site.
//   - Line is reserved the same way; graft's only line/column tracking
//     (pkg/graft/interfaces/position.go) is scoped to tokens inside a
//     single "(( ... ))" expression and never reaches merged values.

	// different slices both start their own Index at 0.

	// same path, exactly as DocumentMemory.Compare does - nil for a
	// path's first recorded change, even when Timeline()/Query() report

// package's Wave B2 coordination note: internal/history and
// internal/histdiff are a separate, CLI-only snapshot-diff mechanism and
// share no code or data with this type).
//
// DocumentMemory is scoped to the whole engine that produced it, not to
// one merge: if TrackHistory() or engine-level WithHistoryTracking/
// WithMemoryConfig is used across more than one merge on the same
// *DefaultEngine, every tracked merge's Document.History() reflects
// every path any of those merges (or evaluations on that engine) has
// ever recorded, not just its own. Build a fresh engine per merge to
// isolate history between them. This scope is also an unbounded-memory
// concern, not only a correctness one: every tracked merge on that engine
// keeps adding to one DocumentMemory.timeline that HistoryConfig's
// MaxEntriesPerPath does not trim (see HistoryConfig.MaxEntriesPerPath's
// doc comment) and RetentionPeriod/CompressValues do not evict or
// compress by themselves (see HistoryConfig.RetentionPeriod's and
// .CompressValues' doc comments) - a long-lived, tracked engine's memory
// use grows without bound unless the caller uses WithMemoryConfig
// directly with MaxTotalVersions, MaxMemoryMB, and CleanupInterval set.
//
// Known, permanent gaps (not fixable by a veneer over the existing
// recording sites):
//
//   - List-element mutations are never recorded. merger computes
//     list-element paths but only ever calls RecordMergeChange for map
//     keys; AllPaths/ChangedPaths/Timeline/Query/ForPath will never
//     contain a list-index path such as "servers.0.name".
//   - A newly added nested subtree is recorded only at its top-level key,
//     not at every descendant path. Merging {"added": {"nested": {"leaf":
//     v}}} onto a document that lacks "added" records exactly one entry,
//     at path "added", carrying the whole subtree as NewValue;
//     ForPath("added.nested.leaf") returns nil. This differs from
//     overwriting an existing deep leaf, which does record at every
//     level ("a", "a.b", "a.b.c") - performSimpleMergeAtPath
//     (merge_builder_impl.go) only recurses into mergeValuesAtPath, and
//     so only records a per-key entry, when overlay's value has a
//     corresponding entry in base; a wholly new key skips that recursion
//     and is recorded once, as a whole-value add, at the point it first
//     appears.
//   - Only PhaseMerge/OpMerge and PhaseEval/OpTransform are ever
//     recorded. PhaseLoad, PhaseManual, PhasePostProcess, OpSet,
//     OpDelete, OpPrune, and OpReplace have no producer - pruning,
//     cherry-picking, and WithPostProcessors post-processors run after
//     evaluation but record nothing.
//   - HistoryEntry.Source and .Line are always zero; see HistoryEntry's
//     doc comment.
