// sanitizeDisplay makes one file-derived string safe to print inside an
// error block. It applies to paths as well as expressions and filenames:
// a YAML mapping key carries exactly the same payloads an operator
// expression can, and a path is printed twice - once in the chain line
// and once in its detail line.
//
// Three properties matter, in order:
//
//   - No escape bytes reach a terminal, so stderr stays clean on a
//     non-tty (the genesis stderr contract).
//   - The result occupies exactly one output line, so it cannot forge a
//     line beginning " - $." that genesis would scrape as an error.
//   - The result is bounded, so a pathological value cannot flood the
//     block.
//
// Two things sanitizeDisplay deliberately does NOT do. It does not
// neutralize "@X{...}" color directives: whether those render or strip
// is a decision the outer ansi layer makes based on whether color is
// enabled on the destination stream (see plans/cycle-detection-provenance.md,
// "Closing the color-directive hole"), and it is orthogonal to display
// safety - a directive left in the text is inert document content until
// something downstream chooses to interpret it. And it does not
// guarantee the result is inert against every possible downstream
// interpreter; it guarantees plain, single-line, valid-UTF-8 output
// containing no raw escape bytes, which is the contract this package's
// callers need.

//
// The direction is what makes the result useful. A filename's
// distinguishing part is its tail, so cutting the tail off leaves a path
// nobody can open, and several inputs under one deep workspace root
// collapse to the same visible text, which defeats the numbered inputs
// list. The rune cap the spec sanctions is for expressions; applying it
// to a 209-character absolute path is what produced that.
